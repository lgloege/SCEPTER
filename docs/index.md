# SCEPTER

SCEPTER (Soil Cycles of Elements simulator for Predicting TERrestrial regulation of greenhouse gases) is a reactive transport model that simulates the reactions and transport of solid, aqueous, and gas species within soil, including the dissolution/precipitation of minerals, three-phase biogeochemical reaction, bio-mixing and uplift/erosion of solid phases, advective and diffusive transport of aqueous species, and gaseous diffusion.

The model is developed for simulating natural and enhanced weathering processes, with its specific features that allow for:

* the explicit bio-mixing of soil, including tilling by farmers
* addition of solid materials on the topsoil
* tracking of particle size distributions, which facilitates surface area calculations for individual solid species.


## Running SCEPTER

This documentation describes how to setup SCEPTER and run new simulations. We encourage new users to start with the Example Simulations, which reproduces output from [Kanzaki et al. (2024)](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/17/4515/2024/).
